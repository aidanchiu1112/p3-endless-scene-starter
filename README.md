Title: River Generator
Description: This project was heavily inspired by Minecraft. The main usage of the project is to let the user generate randomized river formations in an empty biome.
What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect? If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing? I am trying to achieve an effect in which generated tiles can be autotiled according to surrounding tiles. I believe that I have successfully done the task. All generated tiles have rounded edges that connect to tiles of the same type.
